OpenEddi
========

OpenEddi is a next-generation data collection software package. It was born out of the need to collect the wide range of complex social network data. But these needs have created a concept which will collect a nearly endless variety of different data.

**Version 0.0.2**
* Data export is implemented
* Alter interpreters are implemented
* Planning a few different options for collecting alter-alter ties
* There is some framework built for designing / editing pools, but it is far from complete
