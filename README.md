OpenEddi
========

OpenEddi is a next-generation data collection software package. It was born out of the need to collect the wide range of complex social network data. But these needs have created a concept which will collect a nearly endless variety of different data.

**Version 0.0.2** The current version is clunky and scope-incomplete. It lacks any sort of administration or data export capabilities. It does not achieve the modularity of the scope concept.
