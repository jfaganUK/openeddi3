This approach is known as an egocentric study design. Some parts of the data will be shared in class (nothing will be shared outside of class). However, a special feature of egocentric data collection is that the respondent – in this case, you – does not need to give full or real names in responses to the questions, as long as you can remember who the nicknames refer to in real life. So the only bit that is not private is your name, since we need to know whose survey it is in order to discuss the results with you.
