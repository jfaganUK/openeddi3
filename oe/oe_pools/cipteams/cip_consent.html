<p>Hello,</p>
<p>My name is Jeni Cross, and I am a sociology professor at Colorado State. We are conducting a Social Network Analysis of scientific teams. The aim of the study is to examine the social relationships and collaboration among interdisciplinary scientific teams using Social Network Analysis.</p>
<p>I am the Principal Investigator, and Hannah Love, GRA, is the Co-Principal Investigator. The purpose of our research is to better understand how the social network in research teams affects future research outcomes. We are inviting you to take a social network survey three times over the course of two years: once as the research team forms, after one year of working together, and again after two years. Your time commitment for each survey is about 20 minutes. </p>
<p>Your participation in this research is voluntary. If you decide to participate in the study, you may withdraw your consent and stop participation at any time without penalty. </p>
<p>We will be collecting your name, in order to properly utilize the network analysis software. However, once the information from each of the three surveys is entered into the software program, names and all identifying information will be removed from the data file and replaced with a fake ID. Dr. Cross will retain a copy of actual names that match the fake IDs in a separate electronic file, in a folder that only she have access to.</p>
<p>Network diagrams will only be shared without names, unless you request that your name be identified in the diagrams.</p>
<p>There are no known risks or direct benefits to you, but we hope to gain more knowledge about scientific networks.</p>
<p>Please let us know if you have any questions. If you have any additional questions feel free to contact Dr. Jeni Cross (jeni.cross@colostate.edu) or Hannah Love (hannahbethlove@gmail.com). If you have questions about your rights as a volunteer in this research, contact the CSU IRB at: RICRO_IRB@mail.colostate.edu; 970-491-1553.</p>
<p>Thank you,<br>
