<p>We are interested in who you work with to prevent harms of substance use outside of
    BC health authorities and the BC Ministry of Health.</p>
<p>For example, do you work with anyone from a non-profit organization,
    a peer run organization or community group, school districts or municipalities,
    faith organizations or universities to prevent harms of alcohol, tobacco, illicit substances,
    or misuse of prescription drugs? Also, consider if you work directly with peers, families,
    communities or other individuals who are affected by substance use and/or harms of substance use?</p>
<p>There are many examples of public health programs and policies that prevent substance
    use and/or harms of substance use such as harm reduction programs, tobacco reduction,
    school-based programs, and municipal alcohol policies.
    You can list any number of people up to a <strong>maximum of 20</strong> that you have had
    <strong>contact with in the last 12 months</strong>.
<p>Please list each person only once. To protect confidentiality, please use their initials rather than name.</p>
<p>For our analysis to work, it's important that you use their real initials. If two people have the same
    initials, please add an extra character that will help you remember which person is which.</p>
<p>DO NOT INCLUDE:Â  people in your immediate work environment, your supervisor, people in your
    department or health authority, people in other health authorities, or people in the
    Ministry of Health. <strong>We are interested in collaborations outside of health authorities and the
        Ministry of Health.</strong></p>
