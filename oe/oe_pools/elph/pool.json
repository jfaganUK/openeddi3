Be sure to scroll to the bottom to indicate your agreement.</strong></p><p>You are being invited to participate in a study entitled Reducing Health Inequities: The Contribution of Core Public Health Services in BC that is being conducted by Bernie Pauly and other research team members. Bernie is a Scientist at the Centre for Addictions Research in BC (CARBC) and Associate Professor in the School of Nursing at the University of Victoria and you may contact her if you have further questions by emailing bpauly@uvic.ca or by phoning 250 472-5915. This research is being funded by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research.</p><p><strong>Purpose:</strong> The purpose of the ELPH project is to engage in a collaborative, participatory process between researchers and decision makers in all BC health authorities to study and foster learning about the use of an equity lens during a period of complex system change in public health to inform systemic responses for reducing health inequities.</p><p>Research of this type is important because it contributes to staff learning and knowledge development in equity-oriented practices and strategies; strengthens collaboration within and across sectors to work together on reducing health inequities; identifies appropriate tools and frameworks to guide the development, implementation and evaluation of equity strategies; and provides a framework to support ethical public health practice in addressing ethical challenges inherent in developing and providing mental health and substance use services to reduce health inequities.</p><p>You are being asked to participate in this study because of your involvement in public health programs and the expertise that you have in this area.</p>      <p><strong>About the survey:</strong> The focus of this component of the project is to examine the collaborations between public health and others outside health authorities and Ministry of Health with respect to reducing health inequities through preventing the harms of substance use. By \"preventing the harms of substance use\" we mean public health programs and policies that address alcohol, tobacco and/or illicit substance use. If you agree to voluntarily participate in this research, you will be asked to participate in a social network analysis. You would complete a survey identifying any professional relationships that you may have with organizations/ professional positions.  It is estimated that the survey will take approximately 45 minutes of your time to complete.</p>      <p><strong>Risks:</strong> Participation in this study may cause some inconvenience to you as it will require some time commitment. However, the time you spend will be directly related to health equity. In other words, it will take place during work time (unless it is more convenient for you to participate outside work time). There are no known or anticipated risks to you by participating in this research. </p>      <p><strong>Benefits: </strong>By participating in this research you will be making an important contribution to knowledge of how intersectoral collaboration happens and what makes it effective. We hope this information will be useful to people like you who work in public health and to policy makers wishing to make the most of opportunities for collaboration between health and other sectors.</p>      <p><strong>Donation for each survey: </strong> You will also benefit in knowing that for every survey completed, the ELPH project team will contribute $20 (up to a $2,000 maximum, total) to a not-for-profit organization in BC that supports work in health promotion and prevention of harms. You will be asked to select one of three organizations at the end of the survey. We ask that you tell your colleagues about this study to help boost participation and our donation.</p>      <p><strong>Confidentiality:</strong>Please be advised that information about you that is gathered for social network analysis uses a secure web program OpenEddi, which stores the data on encrypted servers at the University of Victoria.  We ask that you complete the survey using your real initials. We need real initials to know whether people occur in more than one network. That is, if someone is identified in two surveys, we’d like to know that this is the same person so that we can combine the networks for a more powerful analysis of intersectoral collaboration. If two people in our data seem like they are probably the same person, but it is not completely clear, we ask for your permission to contact you to ask a few follow up questions. We will ask for your work email address at the end of the survey, but you can still submit a survey even if you don't provide an email address.</p>      <p>Your survey responses will be encrypted. As soon as all the surveys are finished, we will replace all initials of people and names of organizations with codes. The code list will be password protected and kept separately from the survey responses. We will only publish the results of this study in aggregated form. That is, your responses will be combined with responses from others in your organization so that no one person’s responses will appear on their own. Please be assured that information about anyone you identify as a colleague will be kept strictly confidential and will never be reported to anyone outside this study for any reason except in aggregate form.</p>      <p>It is important to note that due to the nature of social network analysis, researchers cannot completely guarantee confidentiality.  However, there are a number of safeguards that will be put into place to protect your confidentiality.  First, your initials will be removed and replaced by a code. Second, no individuals will be identified in any reports or papers emerging from the project.  Finally, members of the research team who are health authority employees will not have direct access to the data.  All data analysis will be conducted by academic members of the research team and research staff. </p>      <p><strong>Voluntary participation:</strong>Your participation in this research must be completely voluntary. If you do decide to participate, you may withdraw at any time without any consequences or any explanation. You may skip questions in the survey by not entering a response. If you do withdraw from the study, the information you provided up to the time of withdrawal will be kept in the dataset unless you indicate otherwise by contacting Dr. Pauly: bpauly@uvic.ca.</p>      <p><strong>Sharing the results:</strong>It is anticipated that the results of this study will be shared with others in the following ways: directly to participants and their organizations, to other health authorities and the BC Ministry of Health through a Knowledge Exchange workshop, through scholarly journal or book chapter publications and presentations at conferences, and on a website.</p>      <p><strong>Data storage: </strong>Data from this study will be secured for 5 years post publication in Bernie Pauly’s office at the University of Victoria in a locked filing cabinet and/or on a password protected computer after which time any paper copies will be destroyed. Electronic data will be saved indefinitely, with all identifying information removed. Data collected during this study may be used for secondary analysis by a graduate student writing a thesis if written permission is obtained from the principal investigator and ethical approval has been granted.</p>      <p><strong>Contact information:</strong></p>      <p>Dr. Pauly: bpauly@uvic.ca, 250-472-5915</p>      <p>Project coordinator: elph@uvic.ca, 250-853-3228, www.uvic.ca/elph</p>      <p>In addition to being able to contact the researcher at the above contact information, you may verify the ethical approval of this study, or raise any concerns you might have, by contacting the following Human Research Ethics offices:</p>      <ul>      <li>University of Victoria at 250-472-4545 or ethics@uvic.ca</li>      <li>Island Health Research Ethics office at 250-370-8620</li>      <li>Research Participant Complaint Line in the University of British Columbia Office of Research Ethics by e-mail at RSIL@ors.ubc.ca or by phone at 604-822-8598 (Toll Free: 1-877-822-8598)</li>      <li>Vancouver Coastal Health operational research approval: research@vch.ca, 604-875-4372</li>      <li>Interior Health Research Ethics Board: 250-870-4602 or researchethics@interiorhealth.ca</li>      <li>Fraser Health Research Ethics Board (REB) co-Chair: 604-587-4681 (Fraser Health approved consent form)</li>      <li>Northern Health Research Ethics office: researchcommittee@northernhealth.ca</li>      </ul>      <h3>Selecting <strong>Agree</strong> below indicates that you understand the above conditions of participation in this study and that you have had the opportunity to have your questions answered by the researchers.</h3>      <p>Email or call us if you have questions: elph@uvic.ca, bpauly@uvic.ca 250-721-6269</p>"
