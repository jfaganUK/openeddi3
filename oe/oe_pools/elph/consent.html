<p>You are being invited to participate in a study entitled Reducing Health Inequities: The Contribution of Core Public
    Health Services in BC that is being conducted by Bernie Pauly and other research team members. Bernie is a Scientist
    at the Centre for Addictions Research in BC (CARBC) and Associate Professor in the School of Nursing at the
    University of Victoria and you may contact her if you have further questions by emailing bpauly@uvic.ca or by
    phoning 250 472-5915. This research is being funded by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research.</p>
<p><strong>Purpose:</strong> The purpose of the ELPH project is to engage in a collaborative, participatory process
    between researchers and decision makers in all BC health authorities to study and foster learning about the use of
    an equity lens during a period of complex system change in public health to inform systemic responses for reducing
    health inequities.</p>
<p>Research of this type is important because it contributes to staff learning and knowledge development in
    equity-oriented practices and strategies; strengthens collaboration within and across sectors to work together on
    reducing health inequities; identifies appropriate tools and frameworks to guide the development, implementation and
    evaluation of equity strategies; and provides a framework to support ethical public health practice in addressing
    ethical challenges inherent in developing and providing mental health and substance use services to reduce health
    inequities.</p>
<p>You are being asked to participate in this study because of your involvement in public health programs and the
    expertise that you have in this area.</p>
<p><strong>About the survey:</strong> The focus of this component of the project is to examine the collaborations
    between public health and others outside health authorities and Ministry of Health with respect to reducing health
    inequities through preventing the harms of substance use. By "preventing the harms of substance use" we mean public
    health programs and policies that address alcohol, tobacco and/or illicit substance use. If you agree to voluntarily
    participate in this research, you will be asked to participate in a social network analysis. You would complete a
    survey identifying any professional relationships that you may have with organizations/ professional positions.  It
    is estimated that the survey will take approximately 45 minutes of your time to complete.</p>
<p><strong>Risks:</strong> Participation in this study may cause some inconvenience to you as it will require some time
    commitment. However, the time you spend will be directly related to health equity. In other words, it will take
    place during work time (unless it is more convenient for you to participate outside work time). There are no known
    or anticipated risks to you by participating in this research. </p>
<p><strong>Benefits: </strong>By participating in this research you will be making an important contribution to
    knowledge of how intersectoral collaboration happens and what makes it effective. We hope this information will be
    useful to people like you who work in public health and to policy makers wishing to make the most of opportunities
    for collaboration between health and other sectors.</p>
<p><strong>Donation for each survey: </strong> You will also benefit in knowing that for every survey completed, the
    ELPH project team will contribute $20 (up to a $2,000 maximum, total) to a not-for-profit organization in BC that
    supports work in health promotion and prevention of harms. You will be asked to select one of three organizations at
    the end of the survey. We ask that you tell your colleagues about this study to help boost participation and our
    donation.</p>
<p><strong>Confidentiality:</strong>Please be advised that information about you that is gathered for social network
    analysis uses a secure web program OpenEddi, which stores the data on encrypted servers at the University of
    Victoria.  We ask that you complete the survey using your real initials. We need real initials to know whether
    people occur in more than one network. That is, if someone is identified in two surveys, we’d like to know that this
    is the same person so that we can combine the networks for a more powerful analysis of intersectoral collaboration.
    If two people in our data seem like they are probably the same person, but it is not completely clear, we ask for
    your permission to contact you to ask a few follow up questions. We will ask for your work email address at the end
    of the survey, but you can still submit a survey even if you don't provide an email address.</p>
<p>Your survey responses will be encrypted. As soon as all the surveys are finished, we will replace all initials of
    people and names of organizations with codes. The code list will be password protected and kept separately from the
    survey responses. We will only publish the results of this study in aggregated form. That is, your responses will be
    combined with responses from others in your organization so that no one person’s responses will appear on their own.
    Please be assured that information about anyone you identify as a colleague will be kept strictly confidential and
    will never be reported to anyone outside this study for any reason except in aggregate form.</p>
<p>It is important to note that due to the nature of social network analysis, researchers cannot completely guarantee
    confidentiality.  However, there are a number of safeguards that will be put into place to protect your
    confidentiality.  First, your initials will be removed and replaced by a code. Second, no individuals will be
    identified in any reports or papers emerging from the project.  Finally, members of the research team who are health
    authority employees will not have direct access to the data.  All data analysis will be conducted by academic
    members of the research team and research staff. </p>
<p><strong>Voluntary participation:</strong>Your participation in this research must be completely voluntary. If you do
    decide to participate, you may withdraw at any time without any consequences or any explanation. You may skip
    questions in the survey by not entering a response. If you do withdraw from the study, the information you provided
    up to the time of withdrawal will be kept in the dataset unless you indicate otherwise by contacting Dr. Pauly:
    bpauly@uvic.ca.</p>
<p><strong>Sharing the results:</strong>It is anticipated that the results of this study will be shared with others in
    the following ways: directly to participants and their organizations, to other health authorities and the BC
    Ministry of Health through a Knowledge Exchange workshop, through scholarly journal or book chapter publications and
    presentations at conferences, and on a website.</p>
<p><strong>Data storage: </strong>Data from this study will be secured for 5 years post publication in Bernie Pauly’s
    office at the University of Victoria in a locked filing cabinet and/or on a password protected computer after which
    time any paper copies will be destroyed. Electronic data will be saved indefinitely, with all identifying
    information removed. Data collected during this study may be used for secondary analysis by a graduate student
    writing a thesis if written permission is obtained from the principal investigator and ethical approval has been
    granted.</p>
